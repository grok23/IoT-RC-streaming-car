This repositry contains sketches for the Arduino Yun.
DCMotorWorks is a sketch which allows for 2 DC motors to be controlled via a L298n H bridge 
DC4MotorsWork1a is a sketch which allows for 4 DC motors to be controlled via 2 L298n H bridges 
DC4MotorsWorka is a sketch which allows for 4 DC motors to be controlled via 2 L298n H bridges and fixed the pin outputs 
so that PWM control of speeds worked.
DCMoSerialCntrl is a sketch that gave us our first manual control of direction using the keyboard to control directions 
via the serial monitor
